EXPERIENCE
• Georgia Tech: Vision Cognition Computation [] Feb 2024 - Present Researcher at Ratan Murty’s Lab Group Atlanta, US
◦ Developing ANN-based linear regression brain models of the PPA, OPA, and RSC by leveraging the PyTorch and Sklearn Machine
Learning libraries. Running inference on Image-Net and black/white box interpretability techniques such as MaCO, as well as recreating fMRI experiments on the models to decipher the true function of these brain-regions.
◦ Learnt to train ResNet50-Clip, AlexNet, etc., on observed fMRI data for natural images. Currently designing experiments to measure responses to sketches/abstract figures. Learning to manipulate taskonomy models and vision-language models like CLIP.
• Georgia Tech: PAIR Lab [] April 2024 - Present Researcher at Animesh Garg’s Lab Group Atlanta, US ◦ Fullstack development of a Teleop App in Flutter for scaling remote robot data collection on Nvidia’s Isaac Sim and MuJoCo.
◦ Wrote a device interface class to decipher controller poses from Meta VR (VR app made on Unity), Keyboards, and Space-Mouse.
◦ Implemented client-server TCP and WebRTC communication as well as Http streaming on Flask web browser to view teleoperation.
• Siemens Intern May 2024 - Aug 2024 Infrastructure and Security Boulder, US
◦ Designed and implemented a web application in React and NodeJS for automated reporting of vulnerabilities in third-party
components from NIST NVD, and included automated data import into defect management systems.
◦ Created GitLab CI/CD pipelines to manage and demo internal vulnerability scanners of .NET applications.
◦ Coded Python script automations with Jira API and performed Black Duck Binary Analysis.
◦ Worked in a Scrum-structured team and observed security analysis of various projects by participating in threat and risk analysis discussions.
• Healiam, Founder Aug 2022 - Present Medical Information Tech Startup Remote
◦ Democratizing healthcare by optimizing the blood testing process to provide affordable direct-to-consumer blood testing. Built the
company to 100k annual recurring revenue since launch in Oct 2022.
◦ Engineered a high performance Laboratory Information System in Python. Developed scripts to extract data via serial port from
blood testing machines and upload them to the cloud.
◦ Utilized Firebase database for queuing and push message technology, and state of the art cloud technologies to implement solutions across client, phlebotomist, and backend.
